# Obj_Identification
We’ve been working on 5 image datasets for Object Identification and Classification. Two of these are the most famous datasets, including “CIFAR-100”, and “MS Coco” datasets.  Additionally, we took a Bangladeshi dataset “Annotated Rickshaw Images” and two Indian datasets, “Indian Food Classification”, and “Indian Vehicle Dataset” .
